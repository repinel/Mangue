# Mangue - Online Manga Reader

The Mangue is a reader for online mangas avaliable at [Manga Panda](http://www.mangapanda.com). It needs access to the internet to work.

Feedbacks are welcome. The project was mainly tested on Kindle 4, but it seems to work on Kindle 3 (although we do not use the Kindlet-1.2.jar).

## Build Instructions

1. Install the requirements.
  * Java 1.4 or greater.
  * Apache Ant.
2. Create the `.kindle` directory in your user home.
  * Copy the following from your Kindle `/lib`
    * `Kindlet-1.3.jar`
    * `json_simple-1.1.jar`
    * `log4j-1.2.15.jar`
  * Copy the `developer.keystore` file from your Kindle.
3. Create the `local.properties` file the project root.
  * Add the line `keystore.alias.prefix=test`. Replace `test` with your keystore alias prefix.
  * Add the line `keystore.storepass=password` to the file. Replace `password` with the keystore password.
  * Both values, `test` and `password` are the default for Amazon's keystore. At least for the Kindle 4.
4. Run the command `ant`.
5. The signed package `Mangue.azw2` should have been created in the `build` directory.

## Installation

To install Mangue, copy the signed package `Mangue.azw2` into the your Kindle `documents` directory.

The compiled package can be found under [Releases](https://github.com/repinel/Mangue/releases). Remember to look for the most recent one.

## Usage

Mangue is very simple to be used. Once you start it, you should see the message bellow:
